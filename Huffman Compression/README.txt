To use HuffmanCompression
Follow these steps:

    1) Have a main function with commandline argument set up with the path to the file you want to compress
    make sure there are no whitespaces in that path
    2) Import HuffmanCompression
        e.x from HuffmanCompression import *
    3) Make an instance of the HuffmanCompression and send in the file name
        e.x <Instance_Name> = HuffmanCompression(<filename>)
    4) To compress, call
        e.x <Instance_Name>.compress()
    5) To decompress, call
        e.x <Instance_Name>.decompress()

    if main.py is provided, do the following:

        1) Have a main function with commandline argument set up with the path to the file you want to compress
        make sure there are no whitespaces in that path
